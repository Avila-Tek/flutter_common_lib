### Deploying to Test Flight and Firebase App Distribution

1. Checkout to the desired branch.
2. Bump the build number in `pubspec.yaml`.
   1. (Optional) Bump the version name in `pubspec.yaml` if you are releasing a new version to the App Store or Play Store.
3. Commit and push the changes.
4. Depending on which workflow you want to trigger, create a new tag **with** `git tag <tag_name>` using one of the following patterns:
   - `vX.Y.Z+N-stg` or `vX.Y.Z+N-staging` to release `staging` flavor to Test Flight and Firebase App Distribution.
   - `vX.Y.Z+N-prod` or `vX.Y.Z+N-production` to release `staging` flavor to Test Flight and Firebase App Distribution.
   - If you want to release to only one platform (Firebase AD or Test Flight), append the desired platform to the tag name. For example, `vX.Y.Z+N-prod-ios` or `vX.Y.Z+N-staging-android`.
5. Push the tag with `git push --tags`.

#### Example
``` sh
$ git tag v1.0.0+1-stg # Will deploy staging flavor to Test Flight and Firebase App Distribution
$ git push --tags
```
